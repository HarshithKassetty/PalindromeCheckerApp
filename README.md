# PalindromeCheckerApp
The objective of the PalindromeChecker App is to design and implement a console-based Java application that validates whether a given string is a palindrome under different conditions, while strengthening core programming fundamentals and data structure concepts.
UC1: Application Entry & Welcome Message
Goal: Display a welcome message in the code using java
Actor: HarshithKassetty
Key Concepts used in UC1:
Class – Acts as a container for the Palindrome Checker application logic.
Main Method – Entry point of the Java application with the signature
public static void main(String[] args).
Static Keyword – Allows the JVM to invoke the main() method without creating an object.
Console Output – System.out.println() is used to display messages on the console.
Application Flow Control – Defines the startup behavior before palindrome processing begins.
