# PalindromeCheckerApp
The objective of the PalindromeChecker App is to design and implement a console-based Java application that validates whether a given string is a palindrome under different conditions, while strengthening core programming fundamentals and data structure concepts.
UC1: Application Entry & Welcome Message
Goal: Display a welcome message in the code using java
Actor: HarshithKassetty
Key Concepts used in UC4:
Character Array (char[]) – A primitive array used to store individual characters of a string for index-based access.
Array Indexing – Accessing elements using index positions starting from 0.
Two-Pointer Technique – One pointer starts from the beginning and the other from the end, reducing unnecessary comparisons.
Time Complexity Awareness – Demonstrates efficient comparison without creating extra objects.
Data Structure: char[]
