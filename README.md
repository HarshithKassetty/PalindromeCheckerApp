# PalindromeCheckerApp
The objective of the PalindromeChecker App is to design and implement a console-based Java application that validates whether a given string is a palindrome under different conditions, while strengthening core programming fundamentals and data structure concepts.
UC1: Application Entry & Welcome Message
Goal: Display a welcome message in the code using java
Actor: HarshithKassetty
Key Concepts used in UC3:
Loop (for loop) – Used to iterate through the characters of the string in reverse order.
String Immutability – In Java, String objects are immutable; every modification creates a new String object.
String Concatenation (+) – Used to build the reversed string character by character (introduced here to later discuss drawbacks).
equals() Method – Used to compare the actual content of two String objects instead of memory references.
Data Structure: String
